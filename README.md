# The Online Cooking Guide 

## Project Description 


## Who is this application for?
This application was designed for people who want to learn the basics of cooking, broaden their cooking knowledge and learn how to bake. It is designed to be user-friendly so anyone can use it.  There are free recipes included in the webpage to entice users to buy one of the packages.

## What does it do?
The webpage holds free recipes which the owner of The Online Cooking Guide can add to or take away from the admin on the website.  The customers can choose from three different packages which have descriptions on them and can easily check out using stripe payments.  Once the payment has been made it is up to the owner of the page to email out their package and details for their coaches.
