# The Online Cooking Guide 

## Project Description 


## Who is this application for?
This application was designed for people who want to learn the basics of cooking, broaden their cooking knowledge and learn how to bake. It is designed to be user-friendly so anyone can use it.  There are free recipes included in the webpage to entice users to buy one of the packages.

## What does it do?
The webpage holds free recipes which the owner of The Online Cooking Guide can add to or take away from the admin on the website.  The customers can choose from three different packages which have descriptions on them and users can see their order history.

## User Experience

<li>I have the three different packages available to purchase on their own page, laid out clearly so customers can see them.</li>
<li>The navigation bar is clearly laid out so customers know how to navigate through the website.</li>
<li>Login and register pages have been created for users to log in and out of.</li>

#### <b>Surface</b>
The website has been designed to focus on cooking, the recipes in the blog and the packages that users can purchase. The webpage follows a plain colour scheme with a pop of colour in each page to keep users interested.  I used vibrant coloured images to make the pictures of the food stand out to the user to reinforce the message that the page is focused on food, cooking and what users could achieve if they buy the packages.
##### <b>Typography</b>
I have used Roboto and sans-serif fonts throughout the webpage. I’ve selected these fonts due to their simplicity, this keeps the website clean and tidy, it allows users to stay focused on what they’re reading rather than getting distracted by crazy fonts.

#### <b>Skeleton</b>
The website  has been designed to be compatible with all screen sizes, they have been tested on iPad Pro, iPhone and on normal browser screen.
